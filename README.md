### Founding and operating Carbonlink Inc. 🌿
I founded [Carbonlink](https://www.carbonlink.io/) alongside [Mitchell Morrison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-morrison2024/) and [Richard Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-zhang139/) at the University of Southern California, in Los Angeles. Carbonlink was a startup in the Climate Technology space focused improving access to, and transparency within the Carbon Credit Market ♻️📈.

At Carbonlink, I served as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for 1.5 years with responsibilities ranging from Growth Strategy to Software/Database Architecture to Product Design to Product Management. I absolutely loved building alongside my team of 10 top-talent software developers. Together, we built the Carbonlink Marketplace platform and API, which gave businesses and developers who signed up access to tools for researching and purchasing high-quality Carbon Credits. In my capacity as CTO, I especially appreciated the hours spent researching new growth channels and strategizing ways to improve customer acquisition and retention. And as an active member of the development effort, I was passionate about using [Terraform & CDK](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/aws-get-started) Infrastructure-As-Code and Amazon Web Services to build a scalable API and developer-friendly SDK for purchasing Carbon Credits from any site.

In January 2024, operations at Carbonlink ceased due to budgetary restrictions and weak signals for short-term profitability in our corner of the Climate Technology space.
