### 😊 Hi, I'm Evan Gabrielson. 😊 Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

In December 2021, I started working as a developer at CarbonLink Inc., a sustainability startup focused on curbing current issues within the carbon credit market. I serve the software and legal/compliance team as Head Of Product, and am always trying to hone my understanding of sustainability practices as well as project management, software development, and blockchain tech. 

I am also a Masters candidate studying Machine Learning & Data Science Masters at the University of Southern California.
