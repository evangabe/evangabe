<br/>

I am a Data Scientist with a strong background in Software Engineering and Full-Stack Development. With a Master's Degree from USC (Fight On!) and extensive professional experience in software engineering, research, and entrepreneurship, I bring a unique blend of technical expertise and strategic thinking to solve complex data-driven problems. Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate!

I founded [Carbonlink](https://www.carbonlink.io/) alongside [Mitchell Morrison](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mitchell-morrison2024/) and had the pleasure of working with an amazing development team including [Richard Zhang](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-zhang139/), [Clement Chan](https://www.linkedin.com/in/1clementchan), [Ian Brash](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iansbrash), [Rohan Kalra](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rohan-kalra) and product designer [Adil Khadri](https://www.linkedin.com/in/adilkhadri). Carbonlink was a startup in the Climate Technology space focused improving access to, and transparency within the Carbon Credit Market ♻️📈. At Carbonlink, I served as Chief Technology Officer (CTO) for 2 years with responsibilities ranging from Growth Strategy to Software/Database Architecture to Product Design to Product Management. I absolutely loved building alongside my team of 10 top-talent software developers. Together, we built the Carbonlink Marketplace platform and API, which gave businesses and developers who signed up access to tools for researching and purchasing high-quality Carbon Credits. In my capacity as CTO, I especially appreciated the hours spent researching new growth channels and strategizing ways to improve customer acquisition and retention. And as an active member of the development effort, I was passionate about using Terraform & CDK Infrastructure-As-Code and Amazon Web Services to build a scalable API and developer-friendly SDK for purchasing Carbon Credits from any site.

In January 2024, operations at Carbonlink Inc. ceased due to budgetary restrictions and weak signals for short-term profitability in our corner of the Climate Technology space.
