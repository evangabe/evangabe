### 😊 Hi, I'm Evan Gabrielson. 😊 Welcome to my GitHub Profile!

In December 2021, I started working as a developer at CarbonLink Inc., a sustainability startup focused on curbing current issues within the carbon credit market. I serve as Head Of Product (CTO) to CarbonLink Inc. with day-to-day responsibilities ranging from hiring and managing 5 top-talent software developers and 2 designers to managing customer and partner relations to strategizing new avenues of growth and more. Day-to-day, I constantly try to hone my ability to transform data into vision and translate vision into better products.

I am also a Masters candidate studying Machine Learning & Data Science at the University of Southern California (USC). Go Trojans!
