# Hello, my name is <br/> Evan Gabrielson 

I co-lead the enterprise observability team at [Glean](https://www.glean.com/about). Our mission is to empower businesses to mine advanced insights across massive corpuses of data about business operations like sales, research & development, legal compliance and more. We try to make running large-scale enterprises a "no-brainer".

Before Glean, I worked on building domain-specific AI services for Asset Management at [Datum](https://datum.xyz/). We created a two-sided platform that eliminated the guesswork and manual labor of managing real estate contracts for Asset Managers while providing counterparties with clarity on contract terms and tenant rights. 

I also founded and led engineering at Carbonlink, a carbon emission accounting and carbon offset management platform. I learned a lot about the tricky economics of solving the Climate Crisis, and have had a keen eye on new opportunities to realign market incentives toward a cleaner future. 

I also conducted research at the University of Southern California in Neuroscience while studying Machine Learning and Computer Engineering.
